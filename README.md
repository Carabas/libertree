# Libertree

The Libertree Project is a community of people committed to empowering the
people of the world to do things on and with computers, without need for or
interference from big business, by way of providing software and other tools
which can be obtained, bought or built with minimal cost and effort.

Libertree is a free, libre, open-source software project which is intended to
provide a way for people to create their own social network.  Libertree social
networks can be free from commercial influence and manifestation, such as
behaviour tracking, user profiling, advertising, data mining and analysis, and
covert information filtering.

The remainder of the documentation found in this repository refers to the
Libertree social network software, and not The Libertree Project as a whole,
unless otherwise explicitly stated.
